CineScope 🎥
Crafting a Comprehensive Movie Rating Platform

Overview
CineScope is a powerful and scalable movie rating platform that combines modern technologies to deliver a seamless experience for users. The platform allows users to authenticate securely, manage movies (CRUD operations), and engage with reviews and ratings. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, while the frontend leverages React, Redux, and RTK Query for state management and API interaction.

This project demonstrates a modular architecture for maintainable, extendable, and efficient development practices, adhering to industry standards.
